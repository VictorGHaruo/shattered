# Shattered

**Shattered** is a 2D platformer game developed in Python as part of the Programming Languages course in the Applied Mathematics program at FGV. The game demonstrates mastery of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts through modularized code and unique mechanics.

Players control three characters—**August**, **Stella**, and **Erik**—each with distinct abilities, to defeat enemies and face the Three Calamities: **Demogorgon**, **Balrog**, and **Ganon**. The gameplay features challenges that require strategic character switching and skillful combat.

- **Unique characters** with specialized attacks and movements.  
- **Dynamic enemies and bosses** tailored to character abilities.  
- **Modular design** ensuring maintainability and efficient development.  
- **Challenging mechanics**, such as double jumps, projectile blocking, and interactive objects.  

This project highlights teamwork, problem-solving, and creative coding solutions, providing an engaging gaming experience.
